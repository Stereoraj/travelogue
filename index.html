		<h2>How CSS works ?</h2>
		<p>HTML browsers will interpret the target elements from the CSS style. Always the first preferences is given to the inline style, then to the internal style and at last to the external files. If no style is mentioned to the specific tag, then the element will be provided with default style defined by the DOM structure which also includes the preferences of the user in the browser</p>
